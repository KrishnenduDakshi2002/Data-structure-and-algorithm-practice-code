/*Algorithms ::

    1.  Algorithm analysis
    2.  asymptodtic analysis
    3.  greedy Algorithm
    4.  divide and conquer
    5.  dynamic programming
    6.  GCD algorithm


Examples of divide and conquer:

    a. merge sort
    b. quick sort
    c. binary search
    d. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
    e. closest pair

vairous sorting techniques:
    a. sorting Algorithms
    b. bubble sort
    c. insertion sort
    d. selection sort
    e. merge sort
    f. shell sort
    g. quick sort

searching Algorithms
    a.linear search
    b. binary search
    c. interpolation search
    d. hashtable


Important catagories of Algorithms::
   
   search : Algorithm to search an item in a data structure
   sort   : Algorithm to sort items in a certain order
   insert : Algorithm to insert item in data structure
   Update : Algorithm to Update an existing item in a data structure
   delete : Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure
   

characteristics of an algorithm

    Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.

    Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

    Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

    Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.

    Feasibility − Should be feasible with the available resources.

    Independent − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.
